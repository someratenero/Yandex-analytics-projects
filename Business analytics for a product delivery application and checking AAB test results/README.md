|Business analytics for a product delivery application and checking A/A/B test results|Mobile application logs, each record is a user action|<ul> <li> Examine the sales funnel </li> <li> Analyze the results of an A / A / B test to find out how changing the font can affect the formation of the funnel </li> </ul>|<ul><li>The  funnel in the app is arranged in this order: main screen - > product  selection -> cart -> confirmation of successful completion of the  purchase.</li><li>At the OffersScreenAppear (product selection) step, the most users are lost - 62% remain, 38% are lost.</li><li>48% of users who go to the main page reach the last step and pay for the product.</li><li>To increase the conversion rate, we should pay attention to the very  first stage - going to the main screen, so that the user would want to  go further to the product catalog. </li><li>The experiment with fonts did not  show significant improvements in performance, so it is necessary to put  forward and prioritize some other hypotheses to increase the number of  users, for example, to make the menu with the catalog more visible and  user-friendly.</li></ul>|<ul><li>pandas</li><li>matplotlib.pyplot</li><li>numpy</li><li>seaborn</li><li>plotly</li><li>scipy.stats</li></ul>|
