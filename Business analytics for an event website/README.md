|Optimization of marketing costs on the events web-site|Site logs with data on sessions, orders, and costs|<ul><li>Identify popular devices and user sources</li><li>Find out which sources pay off the fastest and bring in the most revenue</li></ul>|Sources 1 and 2 buy a lot, return more than others, and pay off well. Sources 3 and 4 are among the most popular, but they do not pay off well, so we should not spend additional budget on them. Source 5 pays off, but slowly. Source 6 and 7 do not provide significant information. Sources 9 and 10 generate revenue slowly. The advertising budget should be divided between 1 and 2 sources. Since the first source has a better payback, we suggest giving more priority to the first sector.|<ul><li>Pandas</li><li>Numpy</li><li>Matplotlib.pyplot</li><li>Seaborn</li></ul>|
